## What is The AS8 Organization?
The AS8 organization is a community for Bangladeshi developers to collaborate on open-source projects and connect with others. There are tons of resources on the internet, but most of the typical Bangladeshi students find it difficult to start their programming journey. We are here to help you out by providing necessary resources, mentorship, and organizing code jams, hackathons, and various kinds of events throughout the year.

## About the Database Application
Maintaining a resourceful database is nowadays crucial for the development of an organization. But only database management isn't sufficient for that purpose. We need to represent them with proper analytics. There is so much going on in the background of such operations. That's why 'The AS8 Organization' took the initiative of creating a database management application that will help them to achieve their goals.
